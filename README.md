**CYBER SECURITY INTERNSHIP
Task 4: Password Security & Authentication Analysis
Name: Yaswanth Vajja
Organization: Elevate Labs
Internship: Cyber Security Internship
Date: January 2026**
1. Introduction to Password Security
Password security is a critical aspect of cyber security because passwords are commonly used to
authenticate users. Weak or poorly managed passwords can lead to unauthorized access, data
breaches, and system compromise.
2. Hashing vs Encryption
Hashing converts a password into a fixed-length value using a mathematical algorithm. It is a
one-way process and cannot be reversed. Encryption, on the other hand, is a reversible process
used to protect data during storage or transmission. Passwords are usually hashed rather than
encrypted.
3. Common Hash Types
MD5 and SHA-1 are older hashing algorithms that are considered weak due to vulnerabilities.
Modern systems use stronger algorithms such as bcrypt, which include salting and multiple rounds
to slow down password cracking attempts.
4. Password Cracking Techniques
Weak password hashes can be cracked using tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper. Dictionary
attacks use predefined wordlists, while brute force attacks try all possible combinations until the
correct password is found.
5. Why Weak Passwords Fail
Weak passwords fail because they are short, predictable, or reused across multiple platforms. Such
passwords can be easily guessed or cracked by attackers using automated tools.
6. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification such as OTPs, biometric
data, or security tokens. Even if a password is compromised, MFA helps prevent unauthorized
access.
7. Recommendations for Strong Authentication
Strong authentication practices include using long and complex passwords, enabling MFA, avoiding
password reuse, using password managers, and regularly updating credentials.
8. Conclusion
This task improved understanding of how passwords are stored, attacked, and protected. Learning
about hashing, cracking techniques, and MFA highlights the importance of strong authentication in
preventing cyber attacks.
